We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored; however, this may downgrade or &apos;break&apos; certain elements of the site&apos;s functionality.

                Hopefully that has clarified things for you, and as was previously mentioned, if there is something that you aren&apos;t sure whether you need or not, it&apos;s usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.
